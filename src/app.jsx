[ ] Deploy project to GitHub Pages:
    https://codeburst.io/deploy-react-to-github-pages-to-create-an-amazing-website-42d8b09cd4d

ðŸ“¦ COMPONENT STRUCTURE
[ ] Create App.jsx
      - Manages state: grid, selectedColor
      - Contains methods: addRow(), addColumn(), setColor(), etc.
      - Renders dropdown & <Table />
[ ] Create components:
      - Table.jsx â†’ parent of TableRow.jsx
      - TableRow.jsx â†’ parent of TableCell.jsx
      - TableCell.jsx â†’ receives color, click handler

ðŸ§© MVP FEATURES (Required)
[ ] User can add rows to the grid
[ ] User can add columns to the grid
[ ] User can select a color from a dropdown menu
[ ] User can click a single cell to change its color
